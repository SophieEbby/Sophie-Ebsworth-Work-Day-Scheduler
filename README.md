# Sophie-Ebsworth-Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

This project is a Work Day Scheduler application that allows a user to plan hourly time blocks in a day. The application displays each hourly block from 9 am to 5 pm and users can save events in each time block. Hourly blocks are color coded: Gray blocks are in the past, red is the present hour, and green blocks are future hours. 

The calendar shows the current day only and the saved events are stored in the local storage which are persistent events.

The technologies used to build this app are: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jquery
- Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/
- day JS - https://day.js.org/

## Usage

Select an hour time block and add text for the event. Then click the save button next to it and this will save the event description to the local storage.
